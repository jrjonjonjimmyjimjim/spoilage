This is the Spoilage Server

The server needs to handle 2 things: a web UI+backend through which you can precisely configure items and their expiration dates.
- backend could have 2 main paths: /editor and /api
  - /editor accepts http connections and responds with html forms
    - /editor/home - Show a list of items. Each list entry shows name and exp date, and has a delete button. Also a form at the top that allows adding new.
      Let's make an html+css+js file spa. Then, after the first GET to /editor/home, it only talks to /api
      STRETCH GOAL - Add ability to pin common items and quick-add them
  - /api houses a rest api that accepts and replies with json
    - /api/summary GET - Reply with an array of items, their autogenerated ids, their days until expiration, and their expiration date
    - /api/item POST - Create a new item, taking in the item name and exp date
    - /api/item PUT - Given an item ID, update name and exp date
    - /api/item DELETE - Delete an item based on its id




This is NOT the Spoilage Client

The client will be programmed on the Arduino and needs to be able to contact the Spoilage Server to both get expiring items and remove expired items.
- STRETCH GOAL - If the client could add a "Leftovers" item with a 7 day expiration that would be nice
- STRETCH GOAL - Reminders; it could remind you to clean out the fridge every Monday and remind you to clean out the freezer once every 2 months
